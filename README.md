#**EXPERIMENT 7 : *Study of Loops in Python***

##*AIM*: **To study and implement different types of looping statements in Python and understand their use in solving repetitive computational problems.** 

*THEORY*:

Loops are control structures used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

Python mainly has two types of loops: while loop and for loop.

A while loop runs as long as the given condition is true.

Loops help reduce repetition and make programs efficient.

Break statement stops the loop immediately when a condition is met.

Continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

Loops are used in programs like factorial calculation, Fibonacci series, palindrome checking, digit counting, and searching elements.

*ALGORITHM*:

*Program 1: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using while loop*

     

*Program 2:Print numbers from 1 to N*

     

*Program 3: Factorial of a number*

  

*Program 4: Fibonacci series using while loop*


*Program 5: Adding limit to Fibonacci series*

    

*Program 6: Reverse a number*

    

*Program 7: Check Palindrome number*

   

*Program 8: Checking Palidrome for string*

    

*Program 9: Another method for checking Palindrome*

 

*Program 10: Count digits in a number*

     

*Program 11: Exit the loop when i is 3*

*Program 12: Search an element in a list*

*Prgram 13: Print only odd numbers (1 to 10)*

    

*CONCLUSION:*

This experiment helped in understanding the concept of loops in Python. Different types of looping operations such as while loop, break statement, and continue statement were implemented. Programs like factorial, Fibonacci series, palindrome checking, digit counting, and searching elements demonstrated how loops simplify repetitive tasks and improve programming efficiency. The experiment enhanced logical thinking and programming skills.
